In recent times the smartphones have experimented a great growth in the number of devices and in the diversity of these. In parallel way, the number of software that take adventage of these device's capabilities  have experimented the same growth.  When this software is created, the developers have a big problem with the lack of homogeneity in this kind of devices (different manufacturers, different platforms, hardwares with different capabilities, ...)

In this PFC we talk about the use of Ionic2 in the development of hybrid applications from a theoretical and practical point of view. These kind of applications try to join development of an application for several devices in an only one development. In order to get this purpose, Ionic2 use web tecnology (HTML, JS and CSS) for develop the application, and a native container run this application. Ionic2 offers necesary tools in order to ease this development, it compile the application's code, it generate the container, it offers an unified API for all platforms,  \ldots

In this whole report we do an introduction to the technologies who are related with hybrid applications. Next, we propose some practices, with these practice the reader will can obtain the necesaries knowledge for create an application using Ionic2
